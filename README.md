# HMM-translator
Parallel text (word-to-word alignment) source:https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/systems/TsinghuaAligner/TsinghuaAligner.html\<br>
The project first tried the bag of words model (BoW model), simply picking most frequent shown english word for chinese word.\<br>
Then tried to build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as translator, in this model, chinese sentence (the sequence of words) is the observation and english translation is the hidden state.
